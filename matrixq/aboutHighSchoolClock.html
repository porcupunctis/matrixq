About HS Clock
</h1>
<br>
<p>
The HS Clock project came about because I wanted to do two things:<br><br>
	1. Brush up on my HTML/CSS/Javascript skills.<br>
	2. Quickly see how much time was left in each class period.<br><br>

Why the retro amber monospace style?<br><br>
	1. I like it and it's my program.  Very nostalgic for an old programmer like me.<br>
	2. It loads fast and uses less memory.  The intention was that this would be<br>
		running in a tab all day and I didn't want it eating up resources.<br>
	3. If you want something else, I will gladly give you the source files so you can edit them any way you want.<br>
	<br><br>
HS Clock is designed to be simple and fast with no ads and no tracking.  It's just<br>
what it needs to be and nothing more or less.  Anything else would just take longer to load.<br>
<br>
HS Clock is now hosted on my personal domain space at www.matrixq.com.<br>
This allows you to access these tools from any computer with a browser<br>
and even on your phone.

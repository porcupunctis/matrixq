The following standards for naming and placing files
should be followed in order to keep the site organized
and easier to maintain in the future:

File Placement:
The index.html, highSchoolClock.html, middleSchoolClock.html, 
and their immediately related help and about files should be
placed at the top level of the heirarchy. Other files such as
comingSoon.html and stub.html may also be placed here.  It is
important to limit the number of files at this level in order
to make maintaining the site easier.

Any .css files should be in the css folder.  At the moment, there
should be only one css file that is used for the entire site to
maintain a consistent look and feel.  Any new css files should be
considered carefully.

Any .js files should be in the js folder regardless of where the
corresponding html file is located.  Files names for js files
should match their respective html file unless they are designed
to be used across many html files within the site.

Any graphics files should be located in the img folder.  If they
are favicons, they should have a name that corresponds with the 
primary html page they are used with.

There are second-level folders for utilities, games, and videos.
All html files related to these categories should be placed in
their matching sub folder along with the menu file for that
category.  

File Naming:
File names should be descriptive as possible without being
inordinately long.  Names should follow the camel-case convention
with the first letter being lower-case.
Files in the second level folders should start with util, game, or
video as appropriate.  If the file represents a Menu, then that
should be the next word in the name.  For example, the main menu
in the video folder should be videoMenuMain.html.
All files should end with an appropriate file type indicator such as
.html, .css, .js, etc.
Corresponding "about" files should start with 'about' and be followed
by the matching html file.

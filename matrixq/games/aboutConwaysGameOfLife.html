<h1>About Conway's Game of Life</h1>

-Created by: Sarah Squirrel, and Elizabeth Carroll
<br>
Conway’s Game of Life is a simulation of bacterial growth. In short it uses a few simple rules in order to decide whether a population lives, dies, or spawns a new population. The simple rules are as follows: If a cell has fewer than two neighbors it dies, if a cell has two or three neighbors it lives, any cell with more than three neighbors dies, and any “dead” or empty cell with three “live” neighbors comes to life.

<h1>Adjusting The Time</h1>
<p>
The "Adjust Seconds" text box allows you to enter a number that will<br>
adjust the time in order to get the HS Clock web page to be in perfect<br>
sync with the bells.  I have found that the network time that our<br>
laptops run on and the phone time that the bells use are about seven<br>
seconds off.  You may be syncing with a different network (maybe you are<br>
using a personal computer or device) or you may be going rogue and just<br>
setting the time without the help of your ISP.  Whatever the case, you can<br>
make it near perfect by entering a positive or negative value here.<br><br>
The number you enter represents a number of seconds to change the time.<br><br>
Use a positive number if the bell is ringing BEFORE the web page changes.<br><br>
Use a negative number if the bell is ringing AFTER the web page changes.<br><br>
Please note that refreshing the page will restore the default "0" setting.<br><br>
In order for the web page to remember your setting, I would have to store a <br>
cookie on your computer.  This may come in a later release.
